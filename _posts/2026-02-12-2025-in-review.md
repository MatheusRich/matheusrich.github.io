I knew this year would be busy, I just didn't know how much so. Being a dad
changed my life drastically, but a lot of other things happened too!

## Parenting

I had so many "firsts" this year as a dad. I saw my daughter talk, eat solid
food, crawl, walk, and many other things I can't even count. It is as rewarding
as it is challenging. Nothing I've done this year would be possible without the
support of my wife, who is an amazing mom and partner. I love you two!

## Career

Four years at thoughtbot. It's been such a journey! I'm glad I have such a great
place to work which allows me to grow in many different directions.

    <li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> / <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>: I don't need to say much about these. They allow me to focus on problems, not language. There's nothing like them, for me.

        <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/what-llms-are-in-ai">LLMs</a>: Everyone is using them, for better or worse. The thing about LLMs is that they amplify all the good <em>and bad</em> things about programmers and their practices. If you practiced TDD and small PRs, good. If you did big diffs, tests after the code... Now the burden is on your team to review that.

      </p>
      <p>
        I've tried stuff like Cursor and Windsurf, but to me the VS Code integration with AI is enough. Shamefully, I haven't tried Claude Code yet.

### Public Speaking

I spoke in two different conferences this year: [Tropical on Rails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFoOmIpMcm0) and [RailsConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozayFBNKO2M).
Both were the same talk — [Ruby Internals: A Guide For Rails Developers](https://www.matheusrich.com/speaking/#ruby-internals-a-guide-for-rails-developers-railsconf-2025) — but these were great achievements for me:

- At Tropical, there were over 600 people, and, not only because of the huge
  audience, being around great speakers like Xavier Noria, Chris Oliver, Rosa
  Gutiérrez, Jackson Pires and many others was inspiring.
- I had the pleasure of speaking at _the last_ RailsConf. It was amazing to be
  part of a conference that I myself had watched online for years.

Going to RailsConf was my first time in the US. I had very little time there,
but I did eat a cheesesteak in Philly, so it counts!

{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/cheesesteak.webp"
    width="400"
%}

I also was accepted to Baltic Ruby and RubyConf Austria, but had to turn them
down for personal reasons.

### Books

I haven't read a lot in the past years (aside from some Asimov), but I decided
to read *something* in 2025. I read two books:

- **Scar Tissue**, a biography of Anthony Kiedis, the lead singer of Red Hot
  Chili Peppers, one of my favorite bands.
- [**Getting Real**](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal), from Basecamp. This is
  the kind of book one can revisit from time to time to get bite-sized advice on
  how to build a software product.

Technically, I also finished [Crafting
Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), but I read it in parts over
the years, so I'm not counting it here.

### Ruby DF

[Ruby DF](https://rubydf.com/), the meetup I run in my city, had a great year!
We hosted 7 events (all time high!) with 9 talks and over 75 attendees. We also
got sponsorship from [Ruby Central](https://rubycentral.org/), which allowed us
to record the meetups and share them on our [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ruby-df).

</div>

### Blogging

{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/articles-per-year.webp"
    width="auto"
%}

I wrote 5 articles in 2025. That is half of what I wrote in 2024, and the lowest
number since 2020. Of course, I had a lot on my plate this year, but I think I
made up for it with the talks.

{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/articles-frequency.webp"
    width="auto"
%}

The articles were fairly distributed throughout the year, with the 3rd quarter
being the most active with two articles. One of them was a guest post for App
Signal about [Ruby Parsing with
Prism](https://blog.appsignal.com/2026/01/07/an-introduction-to-ruby-parsing-with-prism.html),
but it was only published in 2026.

{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/articles-tag-distribution.webp"
    width="auto"
    caption="I wrote mostly about Ruby and programming in general."
%}

### Memopack

Late 2024 I started working on Memopack, an app I'm writing for myself to
replace a bunch of Google Keep notes and other stuff I had scattered around. I
wanted to have a single place to keep a journal (with mood tracking), all my
notes, todos, and other things like bookmarks.

{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/memopack-mood.webp"
    width="auto"
%}

2025 was when things really took off. I've been using it daily, and improving
it as I go. Ruby on Rails is really good for taking these ideas and making them
reality quickly.

{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/memopack-sticker.webp"
    width="auto"
    caption="I did 18 things for the first time in 2025"
%}

I'm even using it to help me write this article. I have tags (called stickers)
for my journal entries, so I can quickly find all the "first time" things I did
this year, for example.

### Open-Source

{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/gems.webp"
    width="500"
%}

My gems were downloaded 87,940 times in total. That's a ~69% YoY increase. I've
released a number of new gems, but the most important are:

1. [**rails-diff**](https://github.com/matheusrich/rails-diff): a gem to help
   you compare files generated by Rails (like Dockerfile, .gitignore, etc) with
   the ones in your repository, making it easier to keep track of changes and
   updates. This gem started entirely vibe-coded with Windsurf as an experiment.
   The code got messy pretty quickly, so I had to steer the AI to write tests
   and do some refactoring. It's still not great, but it got better.
2. [**data_customs**](https://github.com/thoughtbot/data_customs/): a simple gem
   to help you perform safe data migrations in your Rails app. It was an
   extraction of some code I wrote for a client project. It has been working
   really well for us and I plan to keep improving it.

Smaller gems like [argument_parser](https://github.com/thoughtbot/argument_parser) and [planck](https://github.com/thoughtbot/planck) were extractions from the bigger ones. Existing gems like
`end_of_life` got revamps, updates and new releases.

#### Rails

I made [7 commits to
Rails](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/matheus-richard/commits)
this year, contributing to the new [Sign up and
Settings](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/sign_up_and_settings.html) and
[Wishlists](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/wishlists.html) guides.

I opened a few other PRs, but the only one that got merged was [adding the
helper `relative_time_in_words` to
ActionView](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55405). This was an extraction
from Memopack. I hope to extract even more!

#### Ruby

This was a great year for my Ruby contributions! I proposed a few features to
Ruby core:

1. [`String#ensure_suffix`](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/21346):
   **Approved by Matz!** 🎉 This method ensures a string ends with a given suffix
   without duplicating it. It got discussed at the June dev meeting and Matz
   gave the green light. Still waiting for the merge, but I'm thrilled.

2. [`Time#am?` and `Time#pm?`](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/21533):
   Rejected. The edge cases around noon and midnight (is 12:00 AM or PM?) proved
   too ambiguous. I proposed alternatives like returning `false` for those times
   or adding `noon?`/`midnight?` methods, but no consensus was reached.

3. [`Array#values`](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/21615): Rejected. I
   wanted uniform Array/Hash treatment. Unfortunately, it didn't go far.

4. [`Enumerable#join_map`](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/21386):
   Rejected. I proposed combining `map` and `join` into a single-pass method
   (like `filter_map` does for `filter + compact`). Matz rejected it, hoping JIT
   inlining will optimize `.map { }.join` in the future instead.

Not only did I propose these, but I actually provided patches for them (some
written in C). That was on my to-do list for a while, and now it's done. I'm
really proud of that, even if none have been merged yet.

I also participated in several discussions:
- Proposed [`Ruby::Context`](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/21385#note-27) as
  the name for the new namespace feature (it ended up being called `Ruby::Box`).
- Proposed `?=` as an [uninitialized assignment
  operator](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17316) for memoization (although
  this syntax already exists in Ruby for other uses)
- Suggested [`zip_map`](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/4539) as a name for
  `Array#zip_with`.

On the code side, I [fixed a bug on
RubyGems](https://github.com/ruby/rubygems/pull/8963) improving error handling
for missing version files. This work came from [my gem `end_of_life`](https://github.com/matheusrich/end_of_life). I opened a [small
PR to fix docs in Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/13364) as well.

#### Crystal

I cross-pollinated my Ruby work to Crystal! Both [`String#ensure_prefix` and
`String#ensure_suffix`](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/15782) got
approved and merged there. I'm now [officially a Crystal
contributor!](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/commits?author=matheusrich)
🎉

#### Misc

I also had small contributions to several other projects, including
[Kamal](https://github.com/basecamp/kamal),
[Trix](https://github.com/basecamp/trix), [Devise
Invitable](https://github.com/scambra/devise_invitable), [Litestream
Ruby](https://github.com/fractaledmind/litestream-ruby),
[Fizzy](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy),
[StoreModel](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/store_model), and
[Try](https://github.com/tobi/try).

### Game Development

I didn't work on actual game projects like [Frenzy
Jumpers](https://matheusrich.itch.io/frenzy-jumpers) or play with DragonRuby this year,
but I gave a talk about game development for beginners.

<div class="embedded-media embedded-video">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rFahd2DzXxI?si=3FPJS9ZGaM2k9dnm" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Because of the talk, I did touch
[rich_engine](https://github.com/MatheusRich/rich_engine), my little engine for
[terminal games](https://github.com/MatheusRich/terminal_games), a bit.

### Language Development

[Last year](https://www.matheusrich.com/2024-in-review/) I didn't touch langdev
at all, but surprisingly, this year I spent over 128h working on my own
programming language, [Lit](http://lit-lang.org/) (the inspiration for my talk [Ruby Internals: A Guide For Rails Developers](https://www.matheusrich.com/speaking/#ruby-internals-a-guide-for-rails-developers-railsconf-2025)).

I started this language back in 2020 while reading [Crafting
Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), but I finally finished the
book and made something real out of it. I wrote the interpreter in Crystal
(which is why I ended up contributing to Crystal too).

I released 3 versions in 2025:

- **v0.1.0**: The "Hello World" release — basically Lox with different
  syntax, arrays, string interpolation, a pipeline operator (`|>`), and no
  inheritance.
- **v0.2.0**: Removed required semicolons, added methods on primitives,
  anonymous functions, operator overloading, maps, and `else if`.
- **v0.3.0**: Made everything an expression (`if`, `while`, blocks),
  added array/map literals, `do` blocks for one-liners, the `it` default
  parameter (inspired by Kotlin and Ruby), file imports, and augmented
  assignment operators.

```lit
let greeting = if "world" == "world" do "Hello, world!" else do "Goodbye"

# Array and map literals with string interpolation
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let scores = {alice: 95, bob: 87, charlie: 92}

# Using the `it` default parameter with do blocks
numbers.each(fn do println("Number: {it}"))

# Pipeline operator for function composition
fn double do it * 2
fn square do it * it
fn just do it # sorry, I had to

let result = 5 |> just() |> double() |> square()
println(result) # => 100
```

Lit is now expression-oriented and is starting to feel like a real language. My
current goal is building a Lit interpreter in Lit itself, a fun challenge that
helps me find pain points in the design.

### Code Statistics

{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/github.webp"
    width="auto"
%}

According to [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/), I logged almost 999 hours of
coding this year, averaging about 3 hours and 13 minutes a day. That's a
significant jump (+41%) from last year's 704 hours (roughly 2 hours and 45
minutes/day). GitHub confirms this, showing that I made 4006 commits,
nearly 60% more than last year and an all-time high for me.

Aside from work, most of this time went into personal projects: 265 hours on
Memopack, 128 hours on Lit, and about 50 hours on maintaining `end_of_life`.

{%

    src="2025-in-review/coding-week.webp"
    width="auto"
    caption="I was most productive on Wednesdays. Guess which day of the week I had no meetings?"
%}

These aren't numbers I'm trying to optimize for, but it's interesting to see how
they evolve over time. I didn't expect to code *more* in the year I have a newborn to take care of.

## Life & Hobbies

### Italian

{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/duolingo-per-year.webp"
    width="auto"
%}

Another year of Duolingo Italian! I spent 793 minutes learning (55% more than
last year), practiced on 339 days (93% of the year), and kept my streak alive
for 1119 days total. That's over 3 years without breaking the chain.

I'm mostly doing this not to forget what I already know, but it's not a hard
focus for me.

### Music

#### Concerts

I saw Linkin Park live and it was the best concert I've ever been to. The
setlist was perfect, the production incredible, and the crowd sang every word.

On the other side of the stage, I played 3 concerts during the year. The highlight was my
graduation concert at Music School. Three years of study culminating in one
night! We played a mix of international influences (RHCP, John Mayer, Fearless
Flyers) and Brazilian classics (Djavan, Hermeto Pascoal, Luís Bonfá).

{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/live2.webp"

%}
{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/live.webp"
    width="auto"
%}
</div>

#### Streaming

I streamed 12800 minutes, 18% more than last year. I wasn't anticipating that.

{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/minutes-streamed.webp"
    width="600"
%}

Luckily Spotify didn't count all the kids songs I played during this year, so I
got an accurate picture of my listening habits.

{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/spotify.webp"
    width="300"
%}

RHCP was the top artist and Cor dos Olhos was the top album. It's a self-titled
debut from a new indie band, and I had it on repeat.

#### Gear

{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/gear-timeline.webp"
    width="auto"
%}

Like I said last year, I just needed a dual switch for my Ampero, and that's
literally the one thing I got. I'm done with gear, I'm in creation mode now.

{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/gear.webp"
    width="600"
%}

### Working Out

I tried to get back to the gym after my baby was born. I wasn't shooting for
anything specific, but I wanted to get back to the routine. I went sort of
consistently for January, but quit mid February. Having a baby + preparing for
talks was a lot for me to handle on top of everything I already had on my plate.

{% include figure.html src="2025-in-review/training-days.webp" %}

### Gaming

{% include figure.html src="2025-in-review/gaming-hours-per-year.webp" width="600" %}

Contrary to last year, I played *a lot* fewer games. Yes, parenting hit me hard,
but I was also focused on so many other things. Unfortunately, I didn't see my
Playstation Wrapped while it was available, so I don't have exact numbers, but I
have a good estimate. It's a shame Playstation doesn't have a way to retrieve my
game data after the fact (no API, no official app to list it). I only played
Overcooked with my wife, and by the end of the year I started Hollow
Knight: Silksong.

{% include figure.html src="2025-in-review/gaming-hours-by-platform.webp" width="600" %}

I did get a Nintendo Switch 2 as a gift (thank you, Joice!), which opened a
whole new world of games for me. Among a few minor things, I dove deep into
Zelda: Breath of the Wild — amazing game BTW — Mario 3D World and some Mario
Kart World. The Switch is great for playing with friends and family. The
portability is a game-changer! No more boring lines or wait times anywhere!

{% include figure.html src="2025-in-review/gaming-nintendo.webp" width="400" %}

## Expectations x Reality

Let's see how I did with my 2025 goals:

> Figure out being a dad. That's my #1 priority.

There's no such thing as "figuring out being a dad". I'll always be figuring it
out. I'm doing my best every day, and that's what I'll do for the rest of my
life.

> Find a new routine that works for me and my family.

Sort of. It's really f-ing hard. I didn't find the balance yet. I can't work 8h
a day on a chair and not exercise!

> Balance work and personal life.

This has never been a problem for me, luckily. Yes, it's hard to work and be a
parent, but I have the flexibility to do it, and I have a supportive partner.

> Keep my hobbies alive during this new phase.

Yes. I finished my course at Music School, did a bunch of coding on personal
projects, and even found time to play some games and concerts.

> Keep contributing to Rails and Ruby.

Heck yeah! I think my contributions are getting more tangible. Not only feature
requests, but actual code proposals and bug fixes.

> Keep the Ruby DF meetup going (at least 4 events).

Yup! Not only 4, but 7 events! We had a great year, and I'm really proud of what
we built.

> Propose more features to Ruby (and hopefully get one accepted).

I guess I did just that. Four proposals, one accepted. Not bad!

> Talk at more events.

I did it! And I'd speak even more, if I had the time.

> Keep writing (aim at 10 articles).

I wrote, but not 10 articles. But I made up for that with the talks!

> Be more consistent at working out (aim at 2 times a week).

😓 Not at all...

## Writing This Article

This was the article that took me the longest to publish. Not because it took
longer to write, but because I couldn't find the time to start it. This was
actually the fastest one to write because I could use AI to do manual work like
going through all my activity on the Ruby Redmine, instead of me going week by
week to collect the data.

{%
  include figure.html
    src="2025-in-review/article-writing.webp"
    caption="This article took me about 7h to finish"
    width="600"
%}

That made my writing speed increase by approximately 35% compared to last year
(from 371 to 500 words/hour).

## 2026 Goals

This was an amazing year. I got to give talks, visit a new country, see my
daughter learn so many things, and contribute to the community many different
ways. I wanna keep all of that going, and more! Here are my goals for 2026:

- Keep giving talks. Keep writing.
  - There's not a set number for either of these (as long it's more than zero),
    but these are habits I want to keep.
- Keep Ruby DF going strong.
- Keep contributing to Ruby and Rails.
  - Keep extracting stuff from real projects as patches and gems.
- Open-source Memopack?
  - I think it could help others too. I'm not sure what's the best path to make
    this a business.
- Play in at least two concerts.
  - Music is a big part of me, and I want to keep it alive.
- Get back to the gym. One, two times a week. Anything!
  - I just can't afford not to do it.

Can't wait for the next year and all the surprises it has for me! Until then.
