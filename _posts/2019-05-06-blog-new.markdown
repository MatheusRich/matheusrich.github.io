Hello ~~world~~ everyone! I'm Matheus Richard, a Software Engineering undergraduated student at [UnB][unb-link] (Brazil). I'm an open source developer, I love music and my newfound passion is game development.

This is my personal blog, where I'll share my experiences, things and lessons I've learned, and all sort of cool stuff. I believe that teaching is a great way to learn too, so this is a two-way learning process, right?

Besides that, this will be a way to track my evolution as a developer (and as a writer ;D).

I'm living a great time in my life, so there are many cool things happening at the same time. I'm currently working on [my first game][game-link], I [just got accepted on GSoC 2019][gsoc-link] and I'm making a simple pascal compiler, to mention a few of them _(I'll update all this links when I post something about them, so stay tunned!)_.

My intent is to share a bit of what I've learned on those things, and I hope this blog helps you! Have fun!
