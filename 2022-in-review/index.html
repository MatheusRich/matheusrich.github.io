  </p>

  <p>Two thousand and twenty two is over, so, <a href="/categories/#year-in-review">as usual</a>, I took some time to reflect
a bit on the things that happened (or didn‚Äôt happen) during the year.</p>

<aside class="Note Note--info">
  

  

  <p class="content">Inspired by my friend <a href="https://pothix.com/">@PotHix</a>, I‚Äôm including a bit more data (i.e., numbers) in this year‚Äôs review. I‚Äôm nowhere close to what <a href="https://pothix.com/2020/">he does</a>, but it‚Äôs useful anyway.</p>

<h2 id="career"><a href="#career">Career</a></h2>

<p>It has been a great year at thoughtbot. It‚Äôs the best place I‚Äôve worked in, and
I feel like everyone is trying to make it the best it can be. I get to work with
great people and with cool projects. Working with Mozilla was one of the
highlights for me this year. I got promoted and was a mentor in <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/jobs#jobs">the
apprenticeship program</a>, which was a great
experience. I wish more places did something similar.</p>

<aside class="Note">
  <h4>Quick takes:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://nestjs.com/">Nest.js</a>: I hated it! I felt like to get anything done I'd have to do a lot of pumbling. The test infra is not ideal. All the system test examples I saw would mock the DB (which is great for speed), but nothing ever touched the DB which felt really weird. There was no way of knowing if things were actually working. Also, no transactions between tests, so you have to roll back the data on your own.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://openai.com/">Open AI</a>: I haven't done much work with it yet, so take this with a grain of salt. I'm also not interested in Q&amp;A or chatting. I've used it for things like keyword extraction and text summarization, which it handled really well.
    </li>
  </ul>
</aside>

<h3 id="name-pronunciations"><a href="#name-pronunciations">Name pronunciations</a></h3>

<p>Because I don‚Äôt have a ‚Äútraditional name‚Äù, I‚Äôm often asked how to pronounce
it. I figured other folks probably experienced the same, so I added support for
uploading your name pronunciation to an internal thoughtbot tool. Thus, before
going to a meeting with somebody new, you could check how to pronounce their
name.</p>

<p>Turns out this feature was very appreciated, and I even got a shout-out on the
<a href="https://www.bikeshed.fm/323">BikeShed podcast</a> for that. This DEI theme
would appear again in a blog post later in the year.</p>

<h3 id="mining-gold"><a href="#mining-gold">Mining gold</a></h3>

<p>We have a lot of interesting discussions on thoughtbot‚Äôs Slack. I thought those
could also benefit the community in some way, so I created a tool called
GoldMiner that searches those conversations and turns them into <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/tags/this-week-in-dev">blog
posts</a>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm happy with the results, and I‚Äôm working on making it open-source.</p>

<h4 id="brighton--london"><a href="#brighton--london">Brighton / London</a></h4>

<p>In May this year, I flew to Brighton (UK) to meet my coworkers in person for the
first time! It also was my first international trip, which was scary and
exciting. The impostor syndrome hit hard before getting there (I was suddenly
afraid I wouldn‚Äôt be able to communicate properly ü§∑üèΩ), but everything was
fine. I had a wonderful time there. I also spent an extra week in London since I
was so close.</p>

</div>

<p>Some thoughts about being in the UK:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Having sun at 9 PM was almost unbelievable to me. I knew this happened in
other places, but actually seeing it was cool.</li>
  <li>Yeah, eating beans for breakfast is weird;</li>
  <li>Walking in the streets at night or with my phone in my hands was something‚Ä¶
different.
    <ul>
      <li>After getting back to Brazil, I started noticing some things I did all the
time, like always looking over my shoulders, not pulling my phone out of my
pocket when there was some stranger too close in the streets, or rushing to
get in/out of the car as fast as possible.</li>
      <li>I know there‚Äôs no perfect place, but it felt good to have a different
lifestyle for a couple of days.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="azores"><a href="#azores">Azores</a></h4>

<p>In October, we had another meeting, this time in the Azores (Portugal). Being in
a different country but still speaking Portuguese was weird. It was confusing to
switch from English to Portuguese all the time. I would often speak with a
waiter in Portuguese and then in English two minutes later, for example.</p>

<p>Aside from amazing people, friends, and food, I did some hiking and went to the
hot springs.</p>

<p>Thoughts on being in the Azores:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It‚Äôs weird to think I was basically at the top of a volcano.</li>
  <li>The architecture left me with an unsettling feeling: everything felt similar
(like in a Brazilian town), but‚Ä¶ <em>European</em> in some way. Maybe it was the
weather or the asphalt. Also, the beaches had black sand ü§î.</li>
  <li>The accent can be <strong>so difficult</strong> to understand. They will generally soften
their accent when speaking to a tourist, but when they talk between
themselves‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt get a word!</li>
  <li>My favorite restaurant was Tuk√°Tul√°, by far! It has a great view and great
food.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="open-source"><a href="#open-source">Open-source</a></h2>

<p>Overall, I didn‚Äôt do much open-source work this year, but I‚Äôm happy with what I
did.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-life"><a href="#end-of-life">End of Life</a></h3>

<p>January this year, I released my fourth gem:
<a href="https://github.com/MatheusRich/end_of_life">end_of_life</a>, a gem that helps you
find which projects you have that use a deprecated Ruby version. It was one of
those ideas I couldn‚Äôt take out of my head, so I hacked the first version during
a weekend. It is pretty simple, but I think it has a nice UI, and I like how I
<a href="https://github.com/MatheusRich/end_of_life/blob/da5dc945fb69a735a4dc8d8fb947ac2ed31a680e/lib/end_of_life.rb#L39-L44">handled errors using
monads</a>.</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># simplified version of the code that searches for repos with deprecated Ruby</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I like this pipeline, and I don‚Äôt think it looks weird in Ruby. IMO, it‚Äôs much
better than exceptions, which I first started using, and they didn‚Äôt play nice
with Threads; then I had to do all sorts of workarounds, and suddenly everything
was a mess.</p>

<h3 id="rails"><a href="#rails">Rails</a></h3>

<p>I‚Äôve got one <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/44085">PR merged into Rails</a>.
It‚Äôs a small convenience and will be out on Rails 7.1.</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Now it's possible to write</span>
<span class="n">audio_tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">audio_file</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">video_tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">video_file</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I expected this to work, and I was surprised it didn‚Äôt. I believe most of my
contributions to Rails will be similar to this.</p>

<p>I also participated in a few discussions/PR reviews. Some of those PRs <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/43945">got
merged</a>, and others <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/45991">were
rejected</a> in a few minutes. There are
also the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46863">ones I don‚Äôt know yet</a>.</p>

<h3 id="dry-monads"><a href="#dry-monads">Dry Monads</a></h3>

<p>I opened <a href="https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-monads/pull/160">a PR</a> adding a new
feature to dry-monads, but it was rejected. That happens sometimes, and it‚Äôs
okay.</p>

<h3 id="blogging"><a href="#blogging">Blogging</a></h3>

<p>I had the resolution to write one blog post per month in 2021 to force myself to
get back to writing. That worked well, but I hated the pressure all the time.
For this year, I felt that I would naturally write (especially during
<a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/investment-time">Investment Days</a>), so I didn‚Äôt
force anything. I wrote when I felt like it and had time.</p>

<p>Turns out that this worked well. I wrote 14 articles throughout the year (one
more than <a href="https://www.matheusrich.com/all/#2021-ref">last year</a>). The
difference is that (aside from two TILs articles and <a href="https://www.matheusrich.com/2021-in-review/">2021 In Review</a>) all of
them were written in <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/authors/matheus-richardc">thoughtbot‚Äôs blog</a>. I did that so I could reach a larger
audience.</p>

<figure>
  <img class="block mx-auto rounded h-auto " loading="lazy" src="/assets/img/2022-in-review/post-frequency.svg" width="600px" height="auto" />

  
    <figcaption>
      I was sort of consistent with writing, although most of it happened in Q1 and Q4. I didn‚Äôt write anything during Q2.

    </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>My favorite 2022 article is <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/pipelining-without-pipes-in-ruby">Pipelining without
pipes</a> because it
was fun to write and has a silly premise (it even <a href="https://rubyweekly.com/issues/595#:~:text=Pipelining%20Without%20Pipes">appeared on
RubyWeekly</a>).
<a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/working-in-my-native-language-requires-empathy">Working in my native language requires
empathy</a>
was the hit, though. For some reason, it went viral on LinkedIn and got featured
in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/bilingual-empathy-in-the-workplace-5282220/">LinkedIn
News</a>.
All of that felt weird to me. I almost didn‚Äôt publish that article because it
was so intimate, but maybe that very thing was what made people connect to it.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-cards"><a href="#ruby-cards">Ruby Cards</a></h3>

<p>Ruby Cards kept going! I added a card every week (that I wasn‚Äôt on vacation) and
I grew the number of followers a lot! <a href="https://twitter.com/fxn">Xavier Noria</a>
(known author of the gem <a href="https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk">zeitwerk</a>) retweeted
one of the cards at the beginning of the year which bumped the account. Thank
you!</p>

<figure>
  <img class="block mx-auto rounded h-auto " loading="lazy" src="/assets/img/2022-in-review/rubycards-followers.svg" width="600px" height="auto" />

  
    <figcaption>
      Once again, consistency has proven to work. I‚Äôm proud of this growth.

    </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>However, it‚Äôs exhausting to add a card every week. Not only do I have to come up
with something new, but I have to make sure that I didn‚Äôt post the same thing
before (and two years‚Äô worth of cards is quite a lot). I‚Äôve been delaying this
for a while, but I‚Äôll have to automate the creation of cards (at least
partially!) in some way.</p>

<h2 id="hobbies-and-life"><a href="#hobbies-and-life">Hobbies and Life</a></h2>

<p>Unlike last year, I did no pixel art and read no comics in 2022 (and I‚Äôm not
sure if I‚Äôm going to get back at those soon), but there was one thing I really
dug into: music.</p>

<h3 id="music"><a href="#music">Music</a></h3>

<p>One of the first things I did this year was to get my guitar to a luthier. She
was kinda left aside and needed a bit of love. After setting it up, I played a
bit with plugins like AmpliTube, but I knew what I really wanted: an amp.</p>

<p>I did my research, and a few weeks later, I had a Katana in my hands.</p>

<figure>
  <img class="block mx-auto rounded h-auto " loading="lazy" src="/assets/img/2022-in-review/boss-katana.jpg" width="600px" height="auto" />

  
    <figcaption>
      This was the first guitar gear I got in <em>many</em> years.

    </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>I finally can afford these things, so I went all-in this year. I always dreamed
about having a pedalboard and stuff, so I started experimenting with gear little
by little. Here‚Äôs a timeline of all the guitar stuff I ever owned:</p>

<figure>
  <img class="block mx-auto rounded h-auto " loading="lazy" src="/assets/img/2022-in-review/gear-timeline-in-years.svg" width="800px" height="auto" />

  
    <figcaption>
      You can see how I basically owned the same two pieces of gear for 6 years (mostly during college, where I was too broke to buy anything), and how I went nuts in 2022 buying pedals.

<p>Speaking of music, I didn‚Äôt listen to a lot of music as I would in the past. I
don‚Äôt <em>feel</em> like this is true, but it‚Äôs what the numbers show. I‚Äôm sure I would
hear something close to 100k minutes per year during college. Maybe it was all
the waiting at bus stops? Or maybe it‚Äôs because nowadays I also listen to music
from my wife‚Äôs account when we‚Äôre on the car. Anyway, this is not a metric I‚Äôm
trying to move up or down.</p>

<h4 id="bras√≠lia-music-school">Bras√≠lia Music School</h4>

<p>Maybe my excitement with playing guitar was so evident that my wife asked me,
<em>‚ÄúHave you ever thought about going to Music School?‚Äù</em>. I haven‚Äôt thought about
that in years. I was so busy with college that I forgot about it altogether.</p>

<p>Well, there wasn‚Äôt any good reason <em>not</em> to apply, so I did. I played a version
of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWv3cZOBgpM">Everyday I Have The Blues by John
Mayer</a> (I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm too shy to
show you the recording) and was accepted. My first semester was focused on the
basics (pentatonics, how to read sheet music), but I‚Äôve learned so much! I‚Äôm
eagerly waiting for the next one.</p>

<h3 id="im-learning-italian"><a href="#im-learning-italian">I‚Äôm learning Italian</a></h3>

<p>An Italian friend, <a href="https://heyvaleria.github.io/">Valeria</a>, started teaching Italian to a few folks at
thoughtbot. That was the beginning of my journey with Italian. I didn‚Äôt have
plans to learn a new language, but that was the only other language (aside from
English) I ever did on Duolingo before, so why not?</p>

<p>As I said, I tried learning a bit of Italian some years ago, but lost my 90-day
streak and gave it up. This time is different. I‚Äôm taking it more serious: I‚Äôm
not only doing the Duolingo lessions, I‚Äôm listening to podcasts in Italian,
watching shows with Italian dub/subs, reading books and doing Anki cards.</p>

<figure>
  <img class="block mx-auto rounded h-auto " loading="lazy" src="/assets/img/2022-in-review/duolingo.jpeg" width="600px" height="auto" />

  
</figure>

<p>It‚Äôs different from learning English because I‚Äôm not doing formal lessons, so
it‚Äôs more‚Ä¶ casual? At the same time, when I was younger, I learned a bunch of
English without realizing it: I was just reading song lyrics or playing games. I
also don‚Äôt need Italian to work, study, program, watch movies or YouTube, so
it‚Äôs a different approach. To put it simple, I need to engage with the language
<em>actively</em> to learn it.</p>

<p>Music has been a good part of my learning process. I‚Äôve found this fantastic
band called Ministri (which was a large portion of what I listened to in 2022),
and noticed that it‚Äôs easier for me to remember words that came from music
lyrics than random words on Anki.</p>

    <figcaption>
      Three out of the top 5 songs I listened to in 2022 are in Italian.

<h3 id="gaming"><a href="#gaming">Gaming</a></h3>

<p>I played 238 hours in 19 different games over 143 days. Playstation says it‚Äôs
22% (43h) more than last year, but I don‚Äôt feel like that. Here‚Äôs the breakdown
of my top 5 games:</p>

<figure>
  <img class="block mx-auto rounded h-auto " loading="lazy" src="/assets/img/2022-in-review/games-2022.png" width="400px" height="auto" />

  
</figure>

<p>My partner also plays on the same console, so the only games played by me were
Skyrim, Fifa, and It Takes 2. These add up to 93h, which is 36% less than the
previous year‚Äôs 147 hours.</p>

<p>I also didn‚Äôt finish many games (just Stray and It takes 2). I was mainly
playing casually, hence the 30h of Fifa and almost 50h of Skyrim, where I would
roam around without a defined plan. I think this reflects my focus on other
things during the year.</p>

<h2 id="expectations-vs-reality"><a href="#expectations-vs-reality">Expectations vs. Reality</a></h2>

<p>Having tha said, let‚Äôs see how my expectations for 2022 went. Last year I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wanna keep getting involved in Ruby‚Äôs development</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did work on open source a bit, and <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16122#note-31">I was part of the discussion on
naming</a> Ruby‚Äôs 3.2 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Data</code> class
(my suggestions weren‚Äôt the final product, but at least I was there?). No ‚Äúcode
contributions‚Äù, though.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and keep working on my health</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was mostly talking about physical health, and I indeed failed at that. I was
super inconsistent in working out, and I didn‚Äôt practice any sports.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I got back to playing guitar, and I haven‚Äôt invested in it
this much (both in terms of money and time) in a long time. I hope this
compensates for the lack of exercise in some way, but I don‚Äôt want to have to
choose between mental and physical health.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I‚Äôll leave game development on hold for a while and focus on programming
languages. I specifically want to understand how type checkers work and build
a simple one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah‚Ä¶ that didn‚Äôt happen at all. I did not feel like doing any programming
language development this year.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hope I can visit new places this year. An international trip would be
fantastic, but the pandemic might not allow me to do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that was a pleasant surprise. I made not only one but two international
trips! Shout out to my buddy <a href="https://github.com/jmeinerz">Jonas</a> that was such
a lifesaver for me in London.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wish we could live a COVID-free life (at least a mask-free one), but that
probably won‚Äôt happen this year (and maybe neither in the next one).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got COVID in the same month I wrote that, lol ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>

<p>Mask-free life is not exactly what we have. It feels like Covid is a
never-ending matter, and people just decided to live with it, for better or
worse.</p>

<h2 id="2023-goals"><a href="#2023-goals">2023 Goals</a></h2>

<p>2022 felt like the year of music to me. It seems like much of what I‚Äôve done (at
least in my free time) was related to that. I believe that a big part of this
year will be similar.</p>

<p>Again, I want to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù what I don‚Äôt think I succeed at in the previous year.
In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exercise! Sports, gym, whatever it is, I need to move this lazy body.</li>
  <li>I do want to keep on working on core Ruby. TBH, contributing to CRuby feels
too far off from my skill set. Maybe I can work on supporting things like
documentation.</li>
  <li>Keep my work/life balance. This wasn‚Äôt a problem in 2022, and I want to make
sure it keeps not being one.</li>
  <li>Working on something fun! Language development, games, something else? I don‚Äôt
care, as long as I enjoy doing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wow. This took a lot of time to write. Gathering the data from different
sources, compiling it, and actually creating a blog post is hard, but I‚Äôm glad I
did it. See you in 2024!</p>
