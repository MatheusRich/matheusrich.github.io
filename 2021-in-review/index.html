  <p class="content">This is my first <a href="/categories/#year-in-review">year in review</a> article. I plan to do one every year from now! Cya in 365 days!</p>


  
</aside>

<p>Since 2018 I have been writing down things that happened in my life,
particularly the good stuff, as we tend too often to forget about them and
focus on the bad events.</p>

<p>2021 was such a surprising year for me that I figured I could use some of those
notes to reflect and review the year in a blog post.</p>

<h2 id="where-things-started"><a href="#where-things-started">Where things started</a></h2>

<p>For some context, before 2021, I‚Ä¶</p>

<ul>
  <li>was working in my first full-time job with an incredible team at a <a href="https://fretadao.com/">Brazilian startup</a>;</li>
  <li>had just created my <a href="https://github.com/Fretadao/f_service">first</a>
<a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/benchable">three</a>
<a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/ez_attributes">gems</a> and I was pretty excited about
it;</li>
  <li>had started to learn about interpreters with <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a>;</li>
  <li>had made my first <em>major</em> open source contribution: getting a <a href="https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/pull/2778">PR merged into RSpec</a>;</li>
  <li>had left this blog <a href="/all/#2020-ref">picking up dust</a>, and only wrote one article in the entire year of 2020;</li>
  <li>had just started <a href="https://twitter.com/RubyCards">Ruby Cards</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2021"><a href="#2021">2021</a></h2>

<p>Since this blog was pretty much dead and I wanted to get better at writing, I
made a resolution to write a blog post per month in 2021. Turns out that writing
more was one of the decisions that opened many other opportunities for me. The
article ‚Äú<a href="/dont-use-comments-use-code/">Don‚Äôt use comments! Use code.</a>‚Äù, for instance, got featured in
RubyWeekly and got me to talk on a <a href="/talks#comments-are-the-devil-ruby-rogues-podcast">podcast</a> for the first time!</p>

<p>I‚Äôm also glad that I finally graduated from college after all sorts of COVID
nonsense. Not that the degree itself changed anything in my career, but it‚Äôs
nice to take that weight off my shoulders.</p>

<p>Kinda out of nowhere, I decided to <a href="/on-learning-rust">learn Rust</a>. I‚Äôm delighted with Ruby, to be honest. Still, learning a new language is cool, so I
picked one very different (statically typed and compiled). Not exactly the
easiest way to learn a new language, but as one of my first projects, I created
<a href="https://github.com/MatheusRich/lana">Lana</a>, a LISP implemented in Rust
influenced by Clojure.</p>

<h3 id="career"><a href="#career">Career</a></h3>

<p>I was used to doing internal presentations at my previous job, but I gave talks
elsewhere for the first time this year. They were on the <a href="/talks#taming-god-objects">3rd</a> and <a href="/talks#start-tdding-in-5-minutes-lightning-talk">5th</a>
editions of <a href="http://adarb.com.br/">ada.rb</a>, alongside people like <a href="https://github.com/rafaelfranca">Rafael Fran√ßa</a>, who has always been
a role model for me.</p>

<p>Then in the second half of the year, almost by accident, I started working on
one of my dream companies: <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/">thoughtbot</a> ü§ñ. I saw that a fellow Brazilian (<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahraquelsh">@SarahLima</a>) had
joined the company, then I thought, <em>‚ÄúWhat if I tried?‚Äù</em> and here I am.</p>

<aside class="Note Note--info">
  

  

  <p class="content">It‚Äôs amazing how important it is to have someone you can relate to in the places you want to be.</p>


  
</aside>

<p>I never thought I would get here this early in my career! It still feels
otherworldly working with people I always admired, like <a href="https://joshuaclayton.me/">Josh Clayton</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sviccari">Steph
Viccari</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/joelquen">Jo√´l Quenneville</a> (to not mention all the other <strong>amazing</strong> folks
I met after I joined). For sure, this was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made in my life.</p>

<p>On the technology aspect, I still got to work with Ruby, which I absolutely
<em>love</em>, but I got the chance to work with other tools as well, like Next.js and
TypeScript.</p>

<aside class="Note">
  <strong class="">Quick takes:</strong>

  <ul class="">
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>: cool and adds a lot of sanity to JavaScript development.
      The VSCode integration is really good.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>: it's slick and has great docs, but I'm still skeptical about it.
      It felt like overengineering for most cases. I think that
      something like <a href="https://hotwired.dev/">Hotwire</a> or
      <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">LiveView</a> are saner approaches
      (especially for small teams).
    </li>
  </ul>
</aside>

<p>I‚Äôm eager for all the new things I‚Äôll learn and apps I‚Äôll work on within the following years.</p>

<h3 id="open-source"><a href="#open-source">Open-source</a></h3>

<p>Even though I didn‚Äôt release any new library this year, I did some work on
open-source. I contributed to many projects I use daily like <a href="https://github.com/github/view_component/pull/917">ViewComponent</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AMatheusRich+is%3Amerged+">Rails</a>. Beyond writing code, I did more OSS things like reviewing PRs and
issues in Rails. I even wrote a blog post about <a href="/start-contributing-to-open-source-today/">how to start contributing to
open-source</a> to help other folks
start doing it.</p>

<p>I already regularly checked <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/">Ruby‚Äôs issue tracker</a>. This year, though, I got
more <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17938">actively</a> involved in discussions about new additions to Ruby there. This
is a habit that I want to keep for a couple of reasons. First, I want to
understand the shaping of new features in Ruby, and second, I want to
help/influence this process. Doing this led me to my first three commits in
Ruby <sup id="fnref:a" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:a" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <sup>‚àô</sup> <sup id="fnref:b" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:b" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> <sup>‚àô</sup> <sup id="fnref:c" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:c" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="hobbies--life"><a href="#hobbies--life">Hobbies &amp; Life</a></h3>

<p>One of the hobbies I started in 2021 was pixel art. I did a bit of it when I was
a kid but never invested much time in it. I hope to eventually use this
ability to create sprites for my games.</p>

<p>Something that graduating from college did change was playing games
without feeling guilty. I finally experienced some of my most anticipated games
like God of War 2018, Marvel‚Äôs Spider-Man, and Hollow Knight.</p>

<p>I felt the need to read a bit more (non-technical content), so I looked for
alternatives this year. I always had an interest in comics, but I didn‚Äôt have money
to buy them as a kid, so I signed up for Marvel Unlimited. I‚Äôm having a blast
reading Ultimate Marvel!</p>

<h3 id="health"><a href="#health">Health</a></h3>

<p>I have a standing desk, but most of my work is sitting. I know this is not
ideal, so I decided to start working out by year-end. It‚Äôs very recent, but I
have already started seeing the results.</p>

<p>I also had a chance to take PTO and go on some much-needed vacations! After all
this time in the pandemic, it felt good to recharge my mental health.</p>

<h3 id="things-im-proud-of"><a href="#things-im-proud-of">Things I‚Äôm proud of</a></h3>

<p>I‚Äôm really proud of my <strong>consistency</strong>. I wrote one article <em>every month</em>. It
might not look like much now, but it was quite a change from a year where I
basically hadn‚Äôt written anything.</p>

<p>Posting one Ruby Card <em>every week</em> was a massive effort too! And the numbers
reflect my work. I grew the Twitter account from less than 100 to over 500
followers!</p>

<p>The consistency made me be featured on RubyWeekly 3 times <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> <sup>‚àô</sup> <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>
<sup>‚àô</sup> <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> and in the <a href="https://www.bikeshed.fm/309">BikeShed podcast</a>
too!</p>

<p>Contributing to Rails and especially Ruby were my personal highlights of 2021.
I‚Äôve always wanted to do this! I‚Äôm really happy with those achievements.</p>

<h3 id="things-i-wish-i-did-better"><a href="#things-i-wish-i-did-better">Things I wish I did better</a></h3>

<p>Ironically, I wish I had been more consistent with Rust. I didn‚Äôt play with it
as much as I would like. For instance, I haven‚Äôt implemented language-defined
macros in Lana and <a href="https://github.com/MatheusRich/lana/issues">several other
features</a>.</p>

<p>I started the year creating a
<a href="https://github.com/MatheusRich/roguelike">Roguelike</a> (here‚Äôs a <a href="https://twitter.com/matheusrich/status/1397347697074610179">Twitter thread</a>
about it, if you‚Äôre curious) but left it unfinished. I tried learning the
<a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a> game engine, but I didn‚Äôt go too far. I‚Äôm not
good at balancing my liking of game development and programing language design.</p>

<figure>
  <video class="block mx-auto rounded h-auto" src="/assets/img/2021-in-review/roguelike.mp4" width="800px" controls=""></video>
  <figcaption>Pretty barebones, but it was a fun project.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I wish I did more pixel art. I was very excited about it, but I lost momentum by
the end of the year. It‚Äôs hard to be consistent on too many things at the same
time</p>

<p>Talking at RubyConf was another goal of mine, but I changed jobs close to the
CFP deadline, so I missed it. That was a bummer, but I think I made the right
decision.</p>

<h2 id="2022"><a href="#2022">2022</a></h2>

<p>My main goal with 2022 is to keep doing what went well last year and improve
what didn‚Äôt work.</p>

<p>I wanna keep getting involved in Ruby‚Äôs development and keep working on my
health. I‚Äôll leave game development on hold for a while and focus on programming
languages. I specifically want to understand how type checkers work and build a
simple one.</p>

<p>I hope I can visit new places this year. An international trip would be fantastic,
but the pandemic might not allow me to do that.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I wish we could live a COVID-free life (at least a mask-free
one), but that probably won‚Äôt happen this year (and maybe neither in the next
one). Well, one can dream, right?</p>

<p><em>Phew</em>! That‚Äôs it for 2021. It was a surprising, weird year! I hope to see you
in 2023. Take care!</p>
