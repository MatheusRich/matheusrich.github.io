Rust feels like a high-performance language that was made by former C++ users

Crystal feels like a high-performance language that was made by former Ruby users

You can feel it in the trade offs that each language has choosed.

Rust has borrow checker
Rust "string confusion"
Rust has structs and implementations (aka interfaces)
Rust has "sum types" and no null
I actually have to think in lower-level concerns (str vs Strings, array vs Vector)

pattern matching!
  if let/while let
much better tooling (at least in vscode)

Crystal is OOP
Crystal has sum types AND uses it to handle null values (maybe not as powerful, but enough for the majority of cases?)
Crystal I don't think in memory management at all
I dont feel like i'm in a "low level language". To me it just feels like "Typed-Ruby"

is it even a fair comparisson? maybe i should compare crystal to something like
Go (since it's also garbage collected). Those were my thoughts, let me know what you think.
