Imagine you drink a glass of water and go to the kitchen sink to wash it. When you get there, there's a HUGE pile of
dirty dishes in the sink. To wash your glass, you would have to clean all the mess before. You look around... no one's
watching. You carefully put the glass in the sink's corner and sneak out. You walk away thinking _"How things got this
way?"_. The ironic answer comes to your mind: _one glass a day_.

In the same way, software accumulates technical debt over time. Most of the time, tech debt starts from simple actions:
_"let's add another method to that class"_, _"let's add another parameter to that function"_, _"let's duplicate that
code for the 10th time... What? Don't look at me, it's how everyone does this!"_.

Giant classes/functions/modules are like magnets: they attract all responsibilities to themselves and tend to get even
bigger! They have so many things stuffed inside that everything seems to fit in there. That creates a sort of blackhole
that won't stop growing.

I'm not saying you should abstract early. I'm all aboard with [ma'am Sandi Metz][sandi] on _"duplication is far cheaper
than the wrong abstraction"_. I'm just saying that abstraction will have to exist at some point.

## ðŸšª A way out

If you thought _"I can't touch this without breaking all the things"_, you're not the only one. Every developer will
eventually deal with software that has technical debt and sometimes it may even seem that there's no salvation. Luckily,
smart folks like Martin Fowler taught us patterns for dealing with this very situation! The [Strangler Fig
Pattern][strangler], for example, allows us to refactor big classes (or even applications) incrementally, without
breaking backward compatibility!

The point is, in the same way that there are [design patterns][d-patterns] for creating new code and addressing issues,
there [is a list of code smells and refactoring techniques][refactoring] to deal with them as well. Refactoring should
be part of our daily work, not something _special_. We should study, learn and teach others about it. The more we do it,
the easier (and natural) it gets!

## ðŸŽ¸ Gravity is working against me

Bad code attracts (more) bad code. Developers, especially when they're new in a codebase, tend to repeat patterns. That
way, when a piece of code is not that great, expect it to influence similar instances. To prevent this we must resist
inertia. Yeah, it's easy just to follow what everyone's been doing, but this approach won't work forever.

How to do it? Don't just add a new line of that huge method. Don't nest another `if/else` statement. Don't be afraid to
create a small class or extract a small private method. There's no problem with that. Did you touch a function? How can
you improve it? Does it have tests?

Did you just understand a piece of spaghetti code? Don't keep it to yourself! Materialize this knowledge in the code by
renaming variables, functions, extracting small methods to clarify intention, etc. Follow the [boy-scout rule][b-rule] and
always leave the code behind in a better state than you found it.

Those simple actions can be powerful in the long run! One glass a day, that pile gets smaller. You can even have some
partners joining this quest! Soon enough, that sink will be shining, and when it is clean, no one will want to be the
first to leave a dirty dish there.
