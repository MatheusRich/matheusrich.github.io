> You're tired. Really exhausted. Your mind simply isn't responding. You stare at the code, it
> stares back at you. You type some code. It doesn't work. You delete it. The clock says: `04:30
> PM`. <br>You know what you need: **a break**.

Working when we're tired is **really dangerous** (to us and our applications). We write buggy code,
make silly mistakes, that frustrate us, and, finally, _we burn out_. Everyone has been there.So,
what to do rather than keep hammering your head on the keyboard?

In fact, you got a lot of options:

- Lie down (or get up if you've been sitting for a long time);
- Change the room you're working on;
- Take a (short) nap;
- Go on a walk (_to your backyard_ ðŸ˜¢) and look at the sky;
- Play a song on your guitar;
- Play with your pet;
- Tell your loved ones you love them;
- At least go drink some water! You get hydrated and [it may boost your productivity!][water]

The important part is to get some distance from the problem you're facing. **Context switch is
really important**. You may think that breaks will kill your flow, and in fact it's easy to convice
yourself that you don't have time for them, but hear me out: **they work!** Well, you don't have to
trust me, [science has shown this over and over again][science].

## I can't take a nap! I'm working!

I realize not everyone has the freedom/opportunity to do those things. Or you may not be confortable
doing them during work time, and I get it. So, I'll list some alternative tasks you can do instead.
I call them _productive lazyness_, because even thought they're not your main task, they're still
useful (for you and your app)!

### Productive laziness tasks

#### Review Pull Requests from libraries you like

You don't need to be a maintainer to do this! OSS folks have _lots of work_ to do, so go ahead and
give them some help (and maybe you _do_ end up as a maintainer).

#### Open Pull Requests for libraries you like

If you're feeling brave enough, you can help OSS folks too! Fix . Search for issues with tags like
`good-first-issue`, `easy`, `beginner` or `first-time-contributor`.

#### Read docs from languages/libraries you use

This is quite obvious, but learning that one method can save your life later! You may found a new
helper method that makes your code simpler or faster.

#### Read a blog post

This is basically the same as the previous one, but it doesn't have to be technical. You can learn
some productivity technique, read something inspiring or just laugh out loud. I'm pretty sure you
have some marked as "read later" somewhere.

#### Write a blog post

I'm pretty sure you have something to tell. Don't worry, you don't have to finish it right away.
Just put some raw ideas in the paper. You'll perfect it later.

#### Learn some keybindings on your text editor

Consider this a investment: a couple of minutes today saves you a life of keystrokes! You can learn
some terminal tricks too! It is the same idea.

#### Reply that one email you've been postponing

It'll only take you 5 minutes. Get rid of it accumulating dust in your mailbox and in your brain.

#### Pay off some technical debt

This is _by far_ my favorite alternative task. Here you can do what you like the most:

- Fix [N+1 queries][n_plus_one];
- Add tests to improve your test coverage;
- Improve the loading time for some page in your webapp (using lighthouse and other devtools);
- Fix that one exception that your monitoring tool reported. This might be a good opportunity to
  start TDDing. [Here's how][tdd].
- Solve some simple CSS problem: alignments or spacing issues, for example;
- Refactor some nasty code you find. You can do simple things like renaming variables/methods or
  extracting functions/classes.

Remember:

> "A refactor a day keeps the rewrite away!" - _Developer Granny_

You may not fix that nasty bug by the end of the day, but a lest _your app will be faster/cleaner/have more tests_! I think that's a nice trade-off.

### Wrapping up

These short tasks give us small wins, and they motivate us to keep working on annoying chores. You
have ... Here's a _keep-eye_:

Be sure to **make the lazyness time-boxed**, tho! You don't want to spend the whole day in a
alternative task ðŸ˜œ.
