> You're tired. Really exhausted. Your mind simply isn't responding. You stare at the code, it stares
> back at you. You write some char. It does not run properly. You delete it. You look at the clock: `04:30 PM`
> Everyone has been there. You know what you need: **a break**.

Working when we're tired is **really dangerous** (to us and our applications). We write buggy code,
we make silly mistakes, that frustrates us and, finally, _we burn out_. So, what to do instead of
keep hammering your head on the keyboard?

In fact you got a lot of options:

- Lie down (or get up if you've been setting for a long time);
- Change the room you're working on;
- Take a (short) nap;
- Go on a walk (_to you backyard_ ðŸ˜¢) and look at the sky;
- Play a song on you guitar;
- Play with your pet;
- Tell you loved ones you love them;
- At least go drink some water!

The important part is to get some distance from the problem you're facing. **Context switch is
really important**. You may think that breaks will kill your flow, and in fact it's easy to convice
yourself that you don't have time for them, but hear me out: **they work!** Well, you don't have to
trust me, [science has shown this over and over again][science].

## I can't take a nap! I'm working!

I realise not everyone has freedom/opportunity to do those things. Or you may not be confortable
sleeping during work time, and I get it. So, I'll list some alternative tasks you can do instead. I
call it _productive lazyness_, because even thought they're not your main task, they're still useful
(for you and your app)!

### Productive laziness tasks:

1. **Review Pull Requests from libraries you like:** You don't need to be a maintainer to do this! OSS folks have _lots of work_ to do, so go ahead and give them some help (and maybe you _do_ end up as a maintainer);
1. **Read docs from languages/libraries you use:** ;
1. **Ler artigo no medium/dev.to:**
1. **Aprender atalhos no seu editor de texto:**
1. **Learn some keybindings on your text editor:** Consider this a investment. A couple of minutes
   today saves you a life of keystrokes;
1. **Reply that one email you've been :**
1. **arrumar N + 1 ou adicionar cobertura, page speed, css bug, refactoring:**

OBS: Be sure to **make them time-boxed**! You don't want to spend the
whole day in a alternative task ðŸ˜œ.
