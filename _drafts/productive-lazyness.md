> You're tired. Really exhausted. Your mind simply isn't responding. You stare at the code, it stares
> back at you. You write some char. It does not run properly. You delete it. You look at the clock: 16h...
> Everyone has been there. You know what you need: **a break**.

Working when we're tired is **really dangerous** (to us and our applications). We write buggy code,
we make silly mistakes, that frustrates us and, finally, _we burn out_. So, what to do instead of
keep hammering your head on the keyboard?

In fact you got a lot of options:

- Lie down (or get up if you've been setting for a long time);
- Take a nap;
- Go on a walk (_to you backyard_ ðŸ˜¢) and look at the sky;
- Play a song on you guitar;
- Play with your pet;
- Tell you loved ones you love them;
- At least go drink some water!

The important part is to get some distance from the problem you're facing. **Context switch is
really important**. You may think that breaks will kill your flow, and in fact it's easy to convice
yourself that you don't have time for them, but hear me out: **they work!** Well, you don't have to trust me, [science has shown this over and over again][science].

## I can't take a nap! I'm working!

I realise not everyone has freedom/opportunity to do those things. Or you may not be confortable sleeping during work, and I get it. So, I'll give you some alternative tasks you can do. Be sure to make them time-boxed, tho. You don't want to spend the whole day in a alternative task!

NÃ£o pode fazer isso? Ok, tenho uma lista de outras coisas que vc pode fazer no lugar:

- Revisar PRs de uma lib open source que vc gosta
- Ler documentaÃ§Ã£o da stdlib e/or libs que usa
- Ler artigo no medium/dev.to
- Aprender atalhos no seu editor de texto
- arrumar N + 1 ou adicionar cobertura
