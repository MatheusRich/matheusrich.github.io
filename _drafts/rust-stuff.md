I always look for things that may not exist in a language

- No ternary operator. That's okay, with if-expressions is pretty nice (and natural, coming from Ruby).

  - It seems to be highly necessary for some people:
    <img loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" src="/assets/img/rust.png" alt="">

- return last line by default (similar to Ruby)

Unlike Ruby, rust allows trailing (and multiple) underscores in numbers:

```rust
// Both examples work like a charm
let a = 1_;
let b = 1_____;
```

```ruby
a = 1_
# SyntaxError: trailing `_' in number

b = 1__2
# Syntax error too
```

I'm studying through the Rust Book. The Chapter 04 is about Ownershipt. My mind after reading the
ownership rules: ðŸ¤¯. They make SO MUCH sense (I'm just reading, tho). All the pain points in C++
seems to be solved with this magical compiler. Let's see how easy will be coding in it tho.

**Differences with Ruby:** Ranges end value is not included. To me this is weird because

```rust
println!("{}", (1..10).count() // => 9
```

I decided to start learning Rust by (I know, I should've picked somthing simple, but I don't like
putting effort in something "not usable") building a LISP (Make a Lisp)

- 4 spaces tab is hurting me
- Weird having to think about memory in every line of code
- kinda confused about modules
- when I should borrow and when I should move? My default is borrow everything
- String vs &str vs str?
- It's really nice to know that I got a typechecker having my back.
- Some constructors are really well thought out: enums, if let, while let. They fit as glove.

### 2021/04/27

- String confusion is a bit better
  - Thanks to [this blog post](https://www.brandons.me/blog/why-rust-strings-seem-hard) and my
    rustacean friend [@PotHix](http://github.com/pothix)

- Discovered https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy. Imma start using it to help me become more rustacean

- Hashmaps in rust are hard lol

### 2021/06/06

- No kwargs, no hash literal, no anonymous struct. =(

### 2021/06/08

- I hate this box thing.
- It seems to be pretty common to use this for linked lists:

- I'm more comfortable with RUst;
- I did most of the lisperator's net tutorial but failed to implement environments correctly.
  - Could not implement a linked list
  - Tried something with references but got lifetimes everywhere and suddenly I didn't know what I was doing.
  - After a couple of days of failures, I declared bankruptcy and stopped this project. Note to self: start with some tutorials in the lang before trying to translate other language tutorials without know the current language lol
  - Started RISP and it was FAAAR easier to follow. Now I'm even extending the language because it's
    fun (and I really dug a LISP lang so I started copying Clojure's features);
  - Clippy helps me to not make some dumb stuff;
