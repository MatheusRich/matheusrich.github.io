I always look for things that may not exist in a language

- No ternary operator. That's okay, with if-expressions is pretty nice (and natural, coming from Ruby).
  - It seems to be highly necessary for some people:
  <img loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" src="/assets/img/rust.png" alt="">

- return last line by default (similar to Ruby)
