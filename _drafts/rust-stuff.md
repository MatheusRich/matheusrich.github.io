I always look for things that may not exist in a language

- No ternary operator. That's okay, with if-expressions is pretty nice (and natural, coming from Ruby).

  - It seems to be highly necessary for some people:
    <img loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" src="/assets/img/rust.png" alt="">

- return last line by default (similar to Ruby)

Unlike Ruby, rust allow trailing (and multiple) underscores in numbers:

```rust
// Both examples work like a charm
let a = 1_;
let b = 1_____;
```

```ruby
a = 1_
# SyntaxError: trailing `_' in number

b = 1__2
# Syntax error too
```

I'm studying through the Rust Book. The Chapter 04 is about Ownershipt. My mind after reading the
ownership rules: ðŸ¤¯. They make SO MUCH sense (I'm just reading, tho). All the pain points in C++
seems to be solved with this magical compiler. Let's see how easy will be coding in it tho.

**Differences with Ruby:** Ranges end value is not included. To me this is weird because

```rust
println!("{}", (1..10).count() // => 9
```
